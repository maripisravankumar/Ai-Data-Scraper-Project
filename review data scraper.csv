   Just received the macbook pro space grey 2020 Model. This is the higher spec model with core i5 10th gen processor and 16 GB Ram.I was coming from an early 2015 Macbook air and thought that this is the right time to upgrade. The key points that compelled me to upgrade to this new macbook pro vs the macbook air retina 2020 and macbook pro base 2020(8th gen processor)1. i5 10th gen processor with excellent heat rejection. This will enable the macbook to endure heavy loads for longer periods of time.2. 16 GB Ram. Will help in multitasking smoothly and also future proofing mac for atleast 6-7 yrs without any performance compromises3. 2 additional  USB C ports for flexibility and convenience. You can plug the charger on either side of the macbook. My previous charger wire broke down due to continuous bending at the same position. This proved to be a very convenient feature for me. Also it will help in simultaneously connecting more peripherals like External HDDs, Monitors, keyboards and Mouse4. The touchbar is just amazing. Pretty thought of feature with wide range of customisations5. Improved speakers (good base and loudness) with respect to air 2020 and macbook pro base model. You will not need an external speaker with this.After using for a day looks like the battery performance is just equal to my previous macbook air (6-7 hrs of web browsing and video playback). Despite two cooling fans, It gets a little heated up sometimes.Also it is only slightly heavier than my previous macbook air, So I don’t think my portability has been compromised. Instead the actual physical dimensions are quite small as compared to the macbook air for the same 13.3 screen sizeIn my opinion one should only go for it if you can afford it, else stick to macbook air 512 gb as there is a whopping 50k difference between the two. The Macbook air will also get the general work done except for some extremely heavy tasks.",29-Jun-20,Lovely but An expensive Machine!!!!
1,Sourabh Garg,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  MacBook Pro is not repairable. This is especially true for MacBook Pro 2018 and later.Any small problem will cost you more than 1 lacWhat if SSD fails? RAM fails? WiFi/Bluetooth not working? MacBook not charging? MacBook not turning on?You will be trapped in Apple's ploy. All these components are soldered into the logic board. They are inseparable.For all these problem Apple will ask you to replace your entire logic board.  It will cost you more than 1 lac.Third party repair is not an option for MacBook Pro 2018 and later. Apple is now very strict with its supply chain. Apple have made contracts with the OEMs that they cannot sell any chip (Such as the ISL9239, ISL9240, CD3215 and CD3217) outside Apple. This was not the case in prior generations. All this is done so that you cannot repair your new MacBook outside Apple.",10-Oct-20,Think before you buy a MacBook Pro 2019

4,Sunny Raj Keshri,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Upgraded to this machine from macbook pro mid 2012 although it was still nice and working but this one is super fast in terms of performance and super quite on mid2012 a slight noise of hard disk was always audible but ssd is a thing for this decade.!Switching from 500gb HDD on older mac to 256 gb ssd. A but compromise on storage but who cares those extra space we dont need much space for keeping movies now and 256 is manageable.I do like the new keyboard.. everyone keep saying that butterfly keyboard was a hell for macs before 2020 but i did not got the lucky chance to type on a butterfly. People are also saying that this is most advance and improved keyboard on mac well it might be but i liked the old style chiclet keyboard much better than any other modern mac keyboard. It was classy although i will get used to it and forget about the experience of old chicletAlso i got rid of my last device that can run compact disks sooner or later this was going to happen but i feel sorry for those disc that are still lying in my cupboardAt last this device is a great thing to have in 2021 and beyond if you are a mac os lover and want a product to be with you for atleast 5 years.M1 is a new era and its time to bid adeu to intel P.S it was nice to have you with us till now but its time to get rid of you no more intel insideOverall for more better review there are videos on internet. I am just sharing my experiences of new macbook pro M1 as compared to my old mac,08-Jan-21,Beginning of apple silicon era
5,Nitin K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Apple really went all out with this M1 Macbook Pro.Its way more powerful than i5 for sure. Go for it and those worried about 8GB Ram. I have been using it for a week for Mobile App development and it runs very smoothly even with simulators and XCode. No issues at all.The only issue I can think of is that Apple didn't provide a chip with more Graphic power compared to the Macbook Air. Not that the GPU is bad by itself but very few people would really need this Pro model over the Air. It does have the touch bar and much better Sound and a fan for prolonged heavy usage.Also the apps are ready for M1 so don't worry about incompatibility either. Most apps work Native or some unupdated ones with Rosetta 2.,14-Jan-21,Apple Silicon is much better than expected for a Gen 1 chip.
6,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  My MacBook Pro suddenly stopped working after 3 weeks of purchasing it. Took it to Apple service center and they gave a report saying that the hardware is faulty. As we crossed the return period of 1 week, Amazon is not returning or replacing the product. The only option left is to give it for repair and my brand new laptop needs to be opened and repaired by the service center. This is absurd and Amazon customer service has only one response that is to get it repaired.",04-Mar-21,The laptop couldn’t wait to see its first month anniversary
7,Vaneet G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am IT professional so I am giving the feedback accordingly.  Mostly working in DevOps tools.If you try to install github cli , you may face challenges. Clipgrab doesn’t work to download youtube videos but YouTube-dl command line works.Some softwares you need to run Xcode —install again. If you install it once but next time you are going to install another software , you may need to run the xcode command.1. Happy to purchase the product.2. Amazon deliver the product on time.3. Battery life far better as they mentioned4. Power and speed I would not comment because I am not playing any games but boot up and shutdown is extremely fast5. Sound is better then previous Mac.6. Touch pad/bar is extremely cool, slight touch works but rarely require to use it , it’s just few days attractions.7. Bluetooth and Wifi connectivity is better.",21-Feb-21,Good product
8,Niraj,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The device is functioning well and delivery was excellent.However, the initialisation was a little cumbersome. The invoice sent doesn't carry the Serial Number of the MacBook. It is yet to be registered on my name.I will soon buy from the store Apple Maintenance Plan when I will be able to register the MacBook!Would you let me know a way to have the invoice with the Serial Number of the MacBook?",15-Jan-21,Quality
9,Shreyans,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Best performance with sturdy body. Less heating than expected from high graphics softwares,19-Jul-20,Power and portability together
